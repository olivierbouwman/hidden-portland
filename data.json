Through you, HP becomes a living archive of our fair city. Our motto is STAY CURIOUS!\n\n\"Hidden\" refers to a state of mind. It means finding something new to you OR a new perspective on something you've  seen before. New discoveries, ideas, info, light, angles, juxtaposition, patterns, delight, etc. about Portland are all welcome.\n\n\"Curious\" means we like to wonder, sleuth, discover. Leave your thinking/judgmental brain aside, and let yourself experience Portland with all your senses and a full dose of curiosity. We prefer questions to criticisms.\n\n ",

Is this something of interest to others? Any ideas to improve on this or use this data in another way? Anyone else interested in helping with the software development part of this? (GitHub repo is at https://github.com/olivierbouwman/hidden-portland). Biggest next step is to have it update automatically and reliably.

The distinctive fruit, a multiple fruit, is roughly spherical, bumpy, 8 to 15 centimetres (3‚Äì6 in) in diameter, and turns bright yellow-green in the fall. The fruits secrete a sticky white latex when cut or damaged. Despite the name \"Osage orange\",[3] it is not related to the orange.[4] It is a member of the mulberry family, Moraceae.[5] Due to its latex secretions and woody pulp, the fruit is typically not eaten by humans and rarely by foraging animals, giving it distinction as an anachronistic \"ghost of evolution\".[6]",

Here it is.\nAnd the last sculpture, at 36th, SE corner, is supposed to have 2 sculptures but the woman is gone, you can see where it has been broken off of the base.

Since I was headed that way along SE Knapp, I walked along for the final blocks, helping to alert traffic since they did most of their walking in the middle of the street. Fortunately it was very quiet and folks saw us and slowed down. We were able to get them safely to the creek, where the human dad opened up a section of chicken wire fence to allow the mama and her babies through. We were so happy and relieved! We don‚Äôt know why the mama and babies were at the busy street corner, they may have walked a ways from Oaks Bottom wildlife refuge if they were avoiding a predator, or perhaps they were in someone‚Äôs backyard pond and decided the time was right to leave. We‚Äôll never know for sure! These folks are HEROES in my book!!!",

The value of the land and buildings was $875,000. The sanctuary holds nine hundred people, and its stained glass window is the largest of its kind in the Northwest.

The real estate scheme was a bust, and most of the land became dairies, tree farms, or flower farms, and some eventually became naturalized. I‚Äôm guessing that the log cabin was built from the tree farm trees. There are several tracts of the naturalized woods here still, and the remnants of a flower farm was turned into housing only about 10 years ago.

This is where all the old street cars used to be stored when not in use.\nWhen the tracks were removed and the yard repaved for buses, this piece of street car rail was left as a memorial to TriMet's predecessor.

Lelooska was born Cherokee, and was adopted into the Kwakwaka'wakw. He was known  for his mastery of storytelling and carving. This totem Pole is the perfect example of Lelooska‚Äôs work and is a prized part of Portland‚Äôs public art collection.\n\nIt was created to celebrate The Oregon Centennial, which the 100th anniversary of the statehood of the U.S. state of Oregon. Festivities ar eheld all over the state, and local communities created monuments to celebrate the big day! Including another large totem pole, located at the Oregon Zoo, and huge statue of Paul Bunyan in Kenton.\n\nThe Totem was carved from a red cedar that was harvested from the base of Mt. Adams. It is one of the most massive in existence measuring fifty feet high and four feet wide.\n\n:) I hope you enjoy the photos.",

The little, big haired trolls now live under an old trestle railway bridge on the outskirts of Portland, driving along McNamee Road. Thus began Troll-landia!

There are only stairs going up behind the doors, so it's probably not for allowing access for some sort of fuel lines to the basement.\nI'm thinking it's more along the lines of a transom window, but on the bottom, to allow a little fresh air to circulate without being big enough for anyone to sneak through. You probably stick a hook on a stick into that ring and pull upward to unlatch it. How it would stay in an open position is another mystery. Whatever it's origins, it's obvious that it hasn't been used in a very long time.",

At the Pittock Block Building (between SW 9th and 10th Avenues and SW Stark/Harvey Milk  and Washington Streets), on the Stark/Harvey Milk side, next to the Wildfang store), is a door that looks like it lets outward only (there is no knob or handle on the outside) from a staircase. Next to the door, down by the ground, is another small door, about the size of a pet door, but it's unlikely that it is a pet door since it only seems to open outward.\nDoes anyone know the purpose of such a door? I called the Pittock Block Group, but the lady I spoke to didn't know, either.\nMy best guess is that is left over from the days when people had milk delivered to their doors. Perhaps residents of the building stuck their tray of empty bottles part-way through the door so the milkman could collect the empties and refill the tray with fresh bottles.\nDoes anyone know if this is correct, or if not, what the true answer is?",

This  is the moment when the holiday season officially begins in Old Town.\nThe nose, at least in recent history, is always lit the day before Thanksgiving. It requires a manual flipping of a switch on the control panel located at the base of the sign, on the roof of the White Stag building. This is a proud part of the city‚Äôs history.\nRamsay Signs built the original sign atop a manufacturing in Old Town in 1940 and it has seen many incarnations. In the fall and winter, the sign is lit from 4 p.m. to 7 a.m., but it‚Äôs on an old-fashioned, not-exactly-precise analog timer.\nThe holiday tradition of adding a red nose, a la Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, to the sign began in 1959.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jonnyace/",

I found that some of the Glisan family was buried at Riverview Cemetery 8421 SW Macadam. I had never been there in my life, so I went and walked around for a few hours one day. The markers/monuments/stones are not one size fits all, so I wandered a bit.\n\nAnyway, I thought it was beautiful, possibly a little hidden, and wanted to share. You will recognize many names. They have maps and guides of some of the interesting people/monuments. Did you know Virgil Earp, his wife and their daughter are buried at Riverview? Abigail Scott Duniway? Lyle Alzado?

And it provides one of the few access points to (as well as overlooks of) the slough.\n\nAnd the plant is itself is gorgeous!! The modern architecture alone is fascinating; I have SO many pictures of it, along with the property! :)\n\nAnd depicted in two huge rocks are indeed diatoms, which are microalgae. Diatoms are a dominant group of phytoplankton; they're ideal food for zooplankton, newly hatched fish and shrimp, etc. Diatoms account for nearly half of primary production in lakes and oceans.\n\nNualgi (clever term meaning \"nutrition for algae) was recently developed to grow Diatom Algae in wastewater treatment plants, ponds, lagoons, lakes, etc.\n\nAnd I didn't realize that the artist behind this beautiful petroglyph just passed!

The sign was designated a City of Portland Historic Landmark in 1977. In 2014, Willamette Week referred to the \"famous White Stag sign\" as \"one of the most instantly recognizable parts of the Portland skyline\".\nSince its installation in 1940 the sign has carried various messages and animations, generally advertising Portland companies, the longest-lasting version being for White Stag Sportswear, from 1957 until 1997.",

So this would be a good time to remind you that all  posts require a description and a location. The description should include at least one keyword we can search for in the archives, though I encourage you to be as elaborate as you'd like, as more description tends to get more comments & likes. Locations can be a general neighborhood, but cross streets are better. Thank you for contributing to the group! I want everyone to see your discoveries!\n\n(Photo from a Wishing Tree on N.

So I made up this  composite comparing the two. You have to use your imagination here, as Rose Villa is so new that Google Maps still shows it as a construction site. But the red GPS track through the complex follows the sidewalk with four curves to the left and three to the right, just like Lombard St. Those side-by-side images will look more alike when it's possible to get an updated aerial view. On June 15 we have a Pedalpalooza ride scheduled to go to the proposed site of a new pedestrian bridge over the Willamette River, and that ride will pass through Rose Villa. But we will be walking the bikes along this curvy sidewalk as it is an inappropriate place to be riding bikes:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/976212959224140",

On  the right side is the beautiful Columbia. Bringing wind from Washington and the pacific, which at times can be terrifying as it rattles your car and semi trucks barrel behind you. The river looks mostly black with bright reflections of the city of Vancouver and the 205 bridge creating shapes in the distance.

Its hard to keep your eyes on the road because you are captivated by the harmonious siren song of light.

In 1990 Prendergast purchased 40 acres of Northwest Portland property for development from the railroad. The building is located on the southwest corner of NW 10th and Lovejoy. The wheels are most noticeable on the south side of the building in the Kearney Street walkway.",

Because of the condition, it was creepy and from that came The Witches House. Benny and Jerry had quite a few Victorians in the neighborhood and one in NW Portland.

Art Simonson and Gerhardt (Gay) Stabney (the ‚ÄúAr‚Äù and ‚ÄúGay‚Äù of Argay) had very particular ideas of how they wanted the area to look.

Business boomed, and between 1865 and 1872 two additional blocks to the north were purchased. Weinhard's brewing business continued to expand to the point where he even offered to pipe beer directly to the Skidmore Fountain. This offer was declined by civic leaders. By 1890, the brewery produced 100,000 barrels of beer annually.\n\nMore info at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weinhard_Brewery_Complex",

You don't need to know that much, but having some of the geography down of Portland does help.\n\nLooking for volunteers to offer a block of three hours on Mon Dec 28, Tues Dec 29 and Wed Dec 30. Between 10 and 5 pm. Leave a message on the event page with your time availability! If you can't help this time but want to help in January (or need a eve or weekend) Also let me know by commenting on the event page.\n\nLocation is inner SE Portland under the Hawthorne Bridge.\n\nCheers!

Stops  include: the Elevator, McLoughlin House (Dr J my historical crush!), Barclay House and the Stevens-Crawford Heritage House.\n\nThe walking is 1 hour and leaves every 15 minutes all night long! The Rose Farm is an extra stop that can be visited after the tour.\n\nJust thought I'd pass on this unique tour and way to see many of the historic homes of Oregon City. By the way... I kid you not, my last visit to the McLoughlin house I had a weird experience that was shared with the friend I went on the tour with---while downstairs we heard a tour upstairs.

That iconic colorful fruit market sign always stood out to me. (It was a place called Corno's originally) Then it disappeared (when the property was demolished I think for the pipe project, and really changed the look of the district for me). When I was doing research for my Portland at Large guidebook I read that City Liquidators saved the fruit and that another resale shop City Home (139 SE Taylor St, not sure how long they've been here). was reselling it. OF course I didn't remember to look at how much, but it was fun to see parts of the old famous central eastside market.\n\nHere's some pictures in the City Liquidator's memory museum and then a photo of the sign at City Home just a few blocks away.",

So much beautiful detail, the  entire original main hallway preserved and some interesting huge cut outs. A fun building to explore. I got to go on a tour BEFORE the construction, so it was fun to see it after. (one day I'll find those photos and post some below)\n\nI suggest visiting the building next time they are hosting an art opening or if during day hours, their library is pretty incredible and open to the public.\n\nON my visit one thesis exhibit had a fabric-made whale you could sit in, but sadly it closed this weekend before I could tell you about it. OH they have this \"collections\" room with a bunch of cookie jars right now for inspiration. That was super cool!\n\nBuilding is at 511 NW Broadway",

We don't have the kind of admin 24 hour watch team to keep up with it. So they will be taken down with no notice.\n\nThe only kind of poltical posts that make sense here are those that are specifically about our local landscape -- such as the recent grove of trees that developers wanted to take out and neighbors rallied and are raising money to keep.",

In Fairview, the Heslin House Museum & Jail and the Zimmerman Heritage Farm from 1874 in Gresham.\n\nAll run by volunteers -- most are donation, the Barn Museum has a fee, but is free for Multnomah county residents.

The Zimmerman House has a bus 21 stop across the way, The Troutdale museums have a couple bus lines nearby, and looks like the 77 gets you close to the Heslin house with a little bit of walking.

If you've never been, it's a great way to spend an evening viewing lots of wonderful art in the many galleries in the district, as well as  other local businesses and the open air market along NW 13th. Plus plenty of hors d'oeuvres and wines to sample, live music, and many other surprises, such as free mini beauty services from a participating salon.\n\nThe one hidden gem I'm posting about however is Gann Bros. Printing. --The oldest print shop in Portland, They're at the corner of NW 14th and Johnson. A small family owned and operating printing company with Heidelberg presses and mini hand operated presses which they allowed visitors to use to make their own coasters for the 4th of July.\n\nThey participate in every First Thursday, but were very quick to add that if you're in the area and see the light is on, to please come in! They'd love to give you a tour and explain how their presses work And how, in sufficient quantities, their services are actually much less expensive than what modern print shops charge.",

Or maybe I just don't go by at prime times.  I don't remember the door being there on the boat dock that leads to the fire & rescue boats -- but maybe it was added because of increased activity or maybe it was always the plan or I just finally noticed it.\n\nPortland's certainly got a new view of the Willamette since I arrived 15 years ago. NO ONE went in the water then. And I only would go in at the Columbia/Willamette confluence at Kelly Point Park. I know the Big Float was the big motivator to get people into water recreation again, but I have to admit I still can't bring myself to swim or recreate on the Willamette. Maybe by the end of summer this will change but I'm still more apt to head off to the Sandy or Clackamas -- both accessible by public transit by the way!\n\nIt's a bit of a gamble to post here as it may turn into a opinion-fest and if so I'll pull it, but just an observation about Portland's changing landscape!",

Do to their own project they have helped get Gus a memorial at last!\n\nThe dedication/gathering/ceremony will happen at 11:30 at the firefighters section of the cemetery, near the center -- here's a pre-story: http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/05/gus_waterford_black_firefighte.html\n\nand Here's the event: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/fire/article/535312\nBefore the event at Lone Fir there is an 10 am annual memorial gathering at the Portland Firefighter's Park (NW 18th and W Burnside).",

However I'm hoping to get together some limited edition art/prizes for each section completed. We'll see, no real promises there. And we should hopefully make it to Paul Bunyan before sunset.

As our car would close in on the Bay Bridge, you could see the fear in my mom's eyes. She was not strong then. Nearly every time we crossed she'd have a bit of a panic attack.\n\nAfter a childhood of that, I'm still not sure why I moved to the bridge city. My mom managed to pass her fear onto me. I've been here over 10 years now. While it's not as scary as it used to be, my heart does still race every time I cross a bridge today.\n\nThe one that scares me the most is tthis. The St. Johns bridge. When I'm on top, I feel too high up. Like it will crumble into the river at any moment, and when it does, it'll take me with it.

The photo is from two years ago, August,  but the loosestrife is still there.\n\nI walked on a path beaten down through these two meter high flowering plants. The plants were so thick, there was no other vegetation.\n\n\"It forms dense, impenetrable stands, which are unsuitable as cover, food, or nesting sites for a wide range of native wetland animals including ducks, geese, rails, bitterns, muskrats, frogs, toads, and turtles. Many rare and endangered wetland plants and animals are also at risk.\"",
