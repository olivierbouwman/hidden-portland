Through you, HP becomes a living archive of our fair city. Our motto is STAY CURIOUS!\n\n\"Hidden\" refers to a state of mind. It means finding something new to you OR a new perspective on something you've  seen before. New discoveries, ideas, info, light, angles, juxtaposition, patterns, delight, etc. about Portland are all welcome.\n\n\"Curious\" means we like to wonder, sleuth, discover. Leave your thinking/judgmental brain aside, and let yourself experience Portland with all your senses and a full dose of curiosity. We prefer questions to criticisms.\n\n ",

Here is a link to an example map that shows about 1,000 posts: https://olivierbouwman.github.io/hidden-portland/ (click on a pin for more info and a link to each post).\nI wanted to just put this out here and see what you all think. Is this something of interest to others? Any ideas to improve on this or use this data in another way? Anyone else interested in helping with the software development part of this? (GitHub repo is at https://github.com/olivierbouwman/hidden-portland). Biggest next step is to have it update automatically and reliably. I'm not making any promises that I'll take this any further than just this prototype but if there's enough interest maybe we can make something fun!",

Osage orange on Reed Campus.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\nMaclura pomifera, commonly known as the Osage orange, horse apple, hedge, or hedge apple tree is a small deciduous tree or large shrub, typically growing  to 8 to 15 metres (30‚Äì50 ft) tall. The distinctive fruit, a multiple fruit, is roughly spherical, bumpy, 8 to 15 centimetres (3‚Äì6 in) in diameter, and turns bright yellow-green in the fall. The fruits secrete a sticky white latex when cut or damaged. Despite the name \"Osage orange\",[3] it is not related to the orange.[4] It is a member of the mulberry family, Moraceae.[5] Due to its latex secretions and woody pulp, the fruit is typically not eaten by humans and rarely by foraging animals, giving it distinction as an anachronistic \"ghost of evolution\".[6]",

Two names that stand out were Roddy Piper and I think the other one was Tony Borne. I could be wrong about the second one but one of them was definitely Roddy.\n\nDoes anyone else remember this or am I recalling some sort of fever dream I may have been having at the time?

It  was a lot of fun.\nBut there appear to be a couple of them missing - the ones on the SE corner of 21st and also the SE corner of 26th. There's a lot of construction on those corners right now so maybe that's why -- does anyone know whether they have been moved?\nThe one that is usually on the NE corner at 30th wasn't there but then we found it later on 34th! Here it is.\nAnd the last sculpture, at 36th, SE corner, is supposed to have 2 sculptures but the woman is gone, you can see where it has been broken off of the base. I wonder if a vandal took it or if the artists are doing something to it.\nBut it was a lovely day for an art walk!",

This lovely duck family was rescued by a lovely human family, (sorry I don‚Äôt know their names) who walked them from a hugely busy intersection to a side street and then  several blocks to Westmoreland Park, where there is a little wildlife area and creek. Since I was headed that way along SE Knapp, I walked along for the final blocks, helping to alert traffic since they did most of their walking in the middle of the street. Fortunately it was very quiet and folks saw us and slowed down. We were able to get them safely to the creek, where the human dad opened up a section of chicken wire fence to allow the mama and her babies through. We were so happy and relieved! We don‚Äôt know why the mama and babies were at the busy street corner, they may have walked a ways from Oaks Bottom wildlife refuge if they were avoiding a predator, or perhaps they were in someone‚Äôs backyard pond and decided the time was right to leave. We‚Äôll never know for sure! These folks are HEROES in my book!!!",

I did a search for some of the primary terms, so I don't think it's been reported here yet.\n\nThis is a memorial to  Gertrude \"Gert\" Boyle (1924-2019), the \"one tough mother\" who took over Columbia Sportswear after her husband died. (See her Wikipedia page linked below.)\n\nStrictly speaking, I guess only the tree -- a Black Tupelo, according to the plaque -- is planted in her memory.\n\nThe entire garden plot around it, which I discovered on April 9 not long after it was planted, stands in the middle of the PSU Urban Plaza between SW Mill and Harrison (Montgomery street dead-ends on both sides of it to the east and west), so the Trimet transit mall with buses and MAX trains heading south on 5th and north on 6th straddles it, and northbound Portland Streetcars roll right past it on a diagonal a dozen feet or so to the northeast.\n\nSince it's been two months since I shot these photos, the site probably already looks different now.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gert_Boyle",

Anyone happen to have pics of sanctuary/bell/stained glass from inside?\n\n‚ÄúIn 1957, now known simply as First Methodist, the church moved to its current four-acre campus on Southwest Eighteenth Street and Jefferson, where five buildings were constructed. Architects Donald Stewart and Kenneth Richardson designed five buildings, which were constructed using Northwest materials exclusively, including laminated arches, fir siding, and a slate roof. The value of the land and buildings was $875,000. The sanctuary holds nine hundred people, and its stained glass window is the largest of its kind in the Northwest. The seventy-five-foot, forty-ton tower houses Portland's oldest bell, cast in 1850 at Meneely's Foundry in Troy, New York.‚Äù",

I guess I‚Äôm showing my age. I did some  research for a project I did last year, and learned that the original old growth forest was logged in the 1890s and West Portland Park (location of the log cabin) was the first suburban housing development planned in Portland. The real estate scheme was a bust, and most of the land became dairies, tree farms, or flower farms, and some eventually became naturalized. I‚Äôm guessing that the log cabin was built from the tree farm trees. There are several tracts of the naturalized woods here still, and the remnants of a flower farm was turned into housing only about 10 years ago. On SW Vesta between 45 and 47, designated in 1998 as Historic City Landmark.",

The boomer trail can be accessed from the trail at the gate, or drive all the way up for parking and the trail at the top will bring you all the way down and around, I placed a few, but they‚Äôre probably gone or moved by now, and I just loved the rock placement for this one and had to share my find!

This is where all the old street cars used to be stored when not in use.\nWhen the tracks were removed and the yard repaved for buses, this piece of street car rail was left as a memorial to TriMet's predecessor. In keeping with this tradition, the lanes where buses are parked are still called \"tracks\".",

Lelooska was born Cherokee, and was adopted into the Kwakwaka'wakw. He was known  for his mastery of storytelling and carving. This totem Pole is the perfect example of Lelooska‚Äôs work and is a prized part of Portland‚Äôs public art collection.\n\nIt was created to celebrate The Oregon Centennial, which the 100th anniversary of the statehood of the U.S. state of Oregon. Festivities ar eheld all over the state, and local communities created monuments to celebrate the big day! Including another large totem pole, located at the Oregon Zoo, and huge statue of Paul Bunyan in Kenton.\n\nThe Totem was carved from a red cedar that was harvested from the base of Mt. Adams. It is one of the most massive in existence measuring fifty feet high and four feet wide.\n\n:) I hope you enjoy the photos.",

They lived in the darkest depths of castles and caves, stealing human maidens and feasting on stray children. \nHowever, it seems that in the 1960s, something went terribly wrong: the gnarled giant, troll-folk, were shrunk and plasticized into colorful little creatures with big hair and loveable smiles.\n\nA large population of trolls decided it was time to start a new life! The little, big haired trolls now live under an old trestle railway bridge on the outskirts of Portland, driving along McNamee Road. Thus began Troll-landia! There is plenty of room to put troll dolls on other structures, but a panel seems to be the best gathering spot. :)\n\nI hope you all enjoy the photos.",

NW Gordon Street runs downhill from Thurman at the spot where the TriMet Line 15 makes its three-point turn-around. Gordon Street suddenly turns to the right and leaps across a deep no-name canyon and turns into Alexandra Avenue, which then ends abruptly near a Salvation Army facility. So much viaduct for such a tiny street! It was difficult to get a good shot of the viaduct because it's only visible from the roadway immediately adjacent to and on top of it.",

She said that she didn't know what the little door was used for, but she did tell me that there used to be access to the basement at the back of their space, and from a street elevator. She said they used the basement for wine storage for 25 to 27 years of the 37 years they ran the deli. She said the basement used to flood regularly during heavy rains.

I then talked to the nice folks  at Wildfang. One of the ladies is a member of this group! They allowed me into the stairway, where I was able to photograph the interior of the little door.\nThe heavy duty latching mechanism seems to dispel the idea that it's some sort of pet emergency exit. There are only stairs going up behind the doors, so it's probably not for allowing access for some sort of fuel lines to the basement.\nI'm thinking it's more along the lines of a transom window, but on the bottom, to allow a little fresh air to circulate without being big enough for anyone to sneak through. You probably stick a hook on a stick into that ring and pull upward to unlatch it. How it would stay in an open position is another mystery. Whatever it's origins, it's obvious that it hasn't been used in a very long time.",

At the Pittock Block Building (between SW 9th and 10th Avenues and SW Stark/Harvey Milk  and Washington Streets), on the Stark/Harvey Milk side, next to the Wildfang store), is a door that looks like it lets outward only (there is no knob or handle on the outside) from a staircase. Next to the door, down by the ground, is another small door, about the size of a pet door, but it's unlikely that it is a pet door since it only seems to open outward.\nDoes anyone know the purpose of such a door? I called the Pittock Block Group, but the lady I spoke to didn't know, either.\nMy best guess is that is left over from the days when people had milk delivered to their doors. Perhaps residents of the building stuck their tray of empty bottles part-way through the door so the milkman could collect the empties and refill the tray with fresh bottles.\nDoes anyone know if this is correct, or if not, what the true answer is?",

This  is the moment when the holiday season officially begins in Old Town.\nThe nose, at least in recent history, is always lit the day before Thanksgiving. It requires a manual flipping of a switch on the control panel located at the base of the sign, on the roof of the White Stag building. This is a proud part of the city‚Äôs history.\nRamsay Signs built the original sign atop a manufacturing in Old Town in 1940 and it has seen many incarnations. In the fall and winter, the sign is lit from 4 p.m. to 7 a.m., but it‚Äôs on an old-fashioned, not-exactly-precise analog timer.\nThe holiday tradition of adding a red nose, a la Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, to the sign began in 1959.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jonnyace/",

Several group members contributed to this brick before  Carye moved. But not long after it was installed, Pioneer Courthouse Square renovated that area and moved the brick. So yesterday I finally found it again! Thank you, Hidden Portland, for being such a Curious place that celebrates the beauty and details of our fair city. You are now immortalized in Portland's Living Room forever more.\n\n(Special thanks to all the members who contributed, who I am including in the comments below. And extra thanks to Michael at the Travel Portland help desk, who also happens to be a Hidden Portland member!)",

I found that some of the Glisan family was buried at Riverview Cemetery 8421 SW Macadam. I had never been there in my life, so I went and walked around for a few hours one day. The markers/monuments/stones are not one size fits all, so I wandered a bit.\n\nAnyway, I thought it was beautiful, possibly a little hidden, and wanted to share. You will recognize many names. They have maps and guides of some of the interesting people/monuments. Did you know Virgil Earp, his wife and their daughter are buried at Riverview? Abigail Scott Duniway? Lyle Alzado? I think they also have walking tours in non-COVID times.\n\nhttps://www.riverviewcemetery.org/about-us/historical-tour",

This is one of many murals popping up around Portland, painted on the boarded up windows of businesses that were closed because of the  pandemic. The murals in this area, near SW 2nd and Ankeny (and others in Old Town) were spearheaded by the awesome @kaligrey who created an opportunity for artists to improve a very difficult situation for many. So many thanks to her, X Exotic Lounge, and all the other artists and businesses that donated their time, materials and walls to bring some light to our troubled times. If you can, check out all the murals in this area, and practice safe distancing!\n\nDan Cohen Creative Labs",

That clearly blows up my DO theory below. New  theory -- he's spelling out DOCTRINE (a belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a church, political party, or other group), which could be a comment on the fact that the Oregonian previously owned the building. Thoughts?\n\nAs a side note, the artist went back and filled in the green background, thereby covering all the graffiti and making the building look much nicer than it did. (See updated photos in the Comments.)\n\nOriginal: While out walking this morning I saw that someone had painted 3-ft high binary code on the old Oregonian building (SW Yamhill/17th): 0110010001101111\n\nI plugged it into a translator and it apparently means \"do,\" which I took as a call to action, i.e. we can't wait -- we need to do something.

I've seen several yard displays on this page from North and Northeast Portland. Here are a couple from the west side of Sellwood I ran across the past week.\n\nThe fairy island is just off SE 7th and Sellwood Riverfront Park, on either Lexington or Bidwell, I believe; the duckies are on SE Sellwood Boulevard between 9th and 11th, overlooking Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge.",

And it provides one of the few access points to (as well as overlooks of) the slough.\n\nAnd the plant is itself is gorgeous!! The modern architecture alone is fascinating; I have SO many pictures of it, along with the property! :)\n\nAnd depicted in two huge rocks are indeed diatoms, which are microalgae. Diatoms are a dominant group of phytoplankton; they're ideal food for zooplankton, newly hatched fish and shrimp, etc. Diatoms account for nearly half of primary production in lakes and oceans.\n\nNualgi (clever term meaning \"nutrition for algae) was recently developed to grow Diatom Algae in wastewater treatment plants, ponds, lagoons, lakes, etc.\n\nAnd I didn't realize that the artist behind this beautiful petroglyph just passed! Thanks so much for sharing her story, Todd!! https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10423/44",

Here's some St. Johns bridge trivia: The construction of the bridge began a month before the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and provided many county residents with employment  during the Great Depression. Because of its proximity to the Swan Island Municipal Airport, some government officials wanted the bridge painted yellow with black stripes. County officials waited until St. Patrick's Day 1931 to announce that it would be painted green. Happy St. Patrick's Day! üçÄ",

Just never seen it up close and thought the sunlight yesterday illuminated it beautifully",

The first settler to this wonderful space was one Fritz Haeger, in 1888. Mr. Haeger established his old world craft of furniture making, in this location.

Went and toured the USS Blueback Submarine at OMSI for the first time today and one of the guides pointed out that the tiny pinprick holes along the edge of the  propeller, which you can see on the Eastbank Esplanade, are to reduce cavitation bubbles that cause extra noise. This is important because, as anyone who has seen/read the Hunt for Red October knows, sound is the main way sneaky submarines get caught.",

Are there ponds, as indicated by the (already discredited) map?

The river's height is displayed by a second color that moves up and down the bridge's cable and towers. The cooler the temperature, the cooler the color.

The sign was designated a City of Portland Historic Landmark in 1977. In 2014, Willamette Week referred to the \"famous White Stag sign\" as \"one of the most instantly recognizable parts of the Portland skyline\".\nSince its installation in 1940 the sign has carried various messages and animations, generally advertising Portland companies, the longest-lasting version being for White Stag Sportswear, from 1957 until 1997.",

The yard art never disappoints.\n\nI grew up with a grandfather who had a flair for the dramatic when it came to his yard (stone donkeys, large mosaics, a taxidermied  Marlin, just to name a few). I take a particular joy when I see my neighbors keeping that flame alive.\n\nThe horse is a permanent fixture on SE 32nd. The wild and domestic turkeys are seasonal accents. I suspect the red coat is in anticipation of the threatened Thanksgiving snow (or it just looks fetching).\n\nThe wicker lady is a new, fancier addition to the neighborhood yard art. I like to think she was striking a pose.",

I was there on the first floor (southeast corner) when I saw this  beauty. I asked the maintenance person, Brad, about it and he told me this amazing story. The car is all original, has 200 miles on it, and is owned by the man who owns the building (he lives in France). The car had been stored down the street in a warehouse, and Brad was tasked with driving it to its current location in the Ford Building. The unusual color is original - the person who ordered the car wanted to match it to another vehicle he had.\n\nI may have parts of this story wrong. Talk to Brad if you want all the info. His office is across the hall from the car, and he‚Äôs a friendly guy willing to share stories.",

The two photos depict different portions of a slow scan of an aerial shot along what is obviously the Willamette. Judging by the shadow it throws on the river, I'm guessing that's the Steel Bridge in the third photo.",

It's fair to say I have an obsession with mannequins.\n\nToday, I went over to SE Portland and found that PSF had closed, and that the mannequin house had just one lonely mannequin upstairs.\n\nAnyways.

Speaking of cemeteries I think it's time for another free Hidden Portland walking  tour of River View. Let's say Saturday June 16 at 10:00 a.m. Limited to 25 people. Email me at johndoylerodmore@gmail.com, once 25 people and five waiting list folks have signed up I will ask the outstanding admins at HPftC to remove this post.",

I've never stopped to look before, but it looks to me like a catch basin as you'd often see at a natural spring site. The iron pipes look like they could sure be from 1894 too...\n\nEDIT: Pics in comments",

Unlike the school of trout I saw several months ago and have yet to photograph, only one Chinook appears on screen at a time and crosses it fairly rapidly, but you get the idea.\n\nAside from the trout, once when I hurried past I saw a black-and-white aerial photograph, looking straight down at the Willamette, one of the bridges throwing its shadow on the water (the Steel Bridge, I'm guessing), and I think a battleship moored on the bank. I'm guessing it dated from the 1940s.\n\nSo there's a LOT more to the show on those video boxes than what you can see even in an hour of steady viewing on the platform!",

It spans a forested canyon of Trillium  Creek, a tributary of Fanno Creek. The bridge's north end is on SW Boundary Street. The cage was installed in the 80s, I've been told, after a teenager rappelled (successfully) off the bridge. Walking through, it feels a bit like being in a mouse run but the beauty around it is remarkable. It's in my new book, Portland Stair Walks.",

The description should include at least one keyword we can search for in the archives, though I encourage you to be as elaborate as you'd like, as more description tends to get more comments & likes. Locations can be a general neighborhood, but cross streets are better. Thank you for contributing to the group! I want everyone to see your discoveries!\n\n(Photo from a Wishing Tree on N.

But worth the drive for sure. My favorite  was the House of Sarcasm. The artist who lives there is brilliant and if I had the moolah I would ask her to paint mandalas in my bedroom like she did in hers! So cool!\nThe first set of photos is fromThe House of Serendipity, the second is The House of Sarcasm, third, (obviously!)the Airplane House.\n‚úåüèºüòéüíú (oh yeah, there was a dj on the plane wing bustin grooves!

    "text": "I was walking through the new Rose Villa complex built on a hillside in Oak Grove and it struck me that the curvy sidewalk going down the hill was a lot like Lombard Street in San Francisco. So I made up this  composite comparing the two. You have to use your imagination here, as Rose Villa is so new that Google Maps still shows it as a construction site. But the red GPS track through the complex follows the sidewalk with four curves to the left and three to the right, just like Lombard St. Those side-by-side images will look more alike when it's possible to get an updated aerial view. On June 15 we have a Pedalpalooza ride scheduled to go to the proposed site of a new pedestrian bridge over the Willamette River, and that ride will pass through Rose Villa. But we will be walking the bikes along this curvy sidewalk as it is an inappropriate place to be riding bikes:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/976212959224140",

The larger one contains all the gems and minerals mentioned in the Old Testament and the smaller collection has all the gems and minerals named in Revelations. Pretty spectacular stuff. The church has wonderful Povey and non Povey glass throughout but these windows are in rooms not usually accessible to the walk in public.

So this would be a good time to remind you that all  posts require a description and a location. The description should include at least one keyword we can search for in the archives, though I encourage you to be as elaborate as you'd like, as more description tends to get more comments & likes. Locations can be a general neighborhood, but cross streets are better. Thank you for contributing to the group! I want everyone to see your discoveries!\n\n(Photo from a Wishing Tree on N. Williams & Mason: \"Compassion for Me, compassion for Thee.\")",

Origin, doom, order, chaos, consciousness, identity, fear, love, and other abstract concepts that are never physically seen or felt, but remain present forces throughout existence, are given life through imagining physical form. In this case, it responds to the metallic, detached bust of Hernando de Soto that floats suspended in time; both a reference to the DeSoto (Plymouth) Building‚Äôs history and the legacy of the sixteenth century conquistador.\"\n\nhttps://racc.org/public-art/search/?page=details&skip=0&sort_pref=sort_title&results_per_page=9&search_title=&search_artist=&search_keyword=conquistador&search_other=&search_collection=&search_discipline=&search=Search\n\n(also, I really miss the map search function at RACC.)",

On the left side is industry and miles of airport. On rainy nights the airport lights are so colorful, streaming into reflection that blends the colors streaming them for acres. On  the right side is the beautiful Columbia. Bringing wind from Washington and the pacific, which at times can be terrifying as it rattles your car and semi trucks barrel behind you. The river looks mostly black with bright reflections of the city of Vancouver and the 205 bridge creating shapes in the distance. The road seems endless as you are hardly brought to a stop, flying next to this abyss of austere beauty. Its hard to keep your eyes on the road because you are captivated by the harmonious siren song of light. As then you take your leave, your body comes to an easy, and you notice how thrilling a simple drive can be. Drive safe, take turns with a passenger. Tell me about your favorite drive.",

These pictures are of the last trolleys to run on the Portland Traction Company in the 1940s/50s... but there was even a time when you could hop streetcars from Oregon city up to Vancouver WA easily.\n\nI am so captivated by the remnants that occasionally pop up in our maps and in our streets.

The building also had Black Panther/Civil Rights Movement connections during the 60s and 70s. It was also the site of the racially motivated Opossum Incident in the 1980s. So much history and yet the average passer by would probably think of it as nothing more than an old withering away shack.",

However, they didn't block sound. That made teaching in the rooms problematic so the doors were replaced by solid walls in the '70s.

It's hard to find on a map, so I would suggest you google that address to get info on how to get to the clinic; the garden is at the back of the clinic on a side street that doesn't show on the map. It's in the back corner of the clinic complex on the corner of SW Woods St. and SW Water Avenue. It has a lovely gazebo to enjoy a quick duck out of the rain or sun. I'm going to try it for an impromptu tea ceremony or maybe to practice my ukulele!",

This past week when organizing the Hidden Portland Library, I found a little  note about an original Big Boy Sculpture up in NW that you could see from the street but I couldn't remember if I had seen it or someone had just told me about it and I had written it down to check out later. Well I found him (again?)! (ahem, Gretchin Lair FYI)\n\nI tried to get up closer but he disappeared except for the burger. So best view is from Willam Temple 2230 NW Glisan. The Big Boy is between 22nd and 23rd on Glisan.\n\nWhen Portland had the amazing American Advertising Museum way back when (closed in 2003) they had a Big Boy in the window on NW 5th. I don't think this is the same one.. the collection got sold though.. so who knows!",

Benny and Jerry called it ...The Witch's House.\nIt was in quite a state of disrepair. One fellow was living on the first floor but it really wasn't habitable. Because of the condition, it was creepy and from that came The Witches House. Benny and Jerry had quite a few Victorians in the neighborhood and one in NW Portland. My sister's and myself had Buttertoe's Restaurant, which is now the Pied Cow. They owned that house too.

There is a uniformity about it that is quite striking, so I finally grabbed a homeowner at a yard sale and asked her what was going on there. She told me that part of the terms of agreement when the Argay neighborhood was originally built in 1961 included a long term maintenance contract and very strict concepts of what was allowed and not allowed. Art Simonson and Gerhardt (Gay) Stabney (the ‚ÄúAr‚Äù and ‚ÄúGay‚Äù of Argay) had very particular ideas of how they wanted the area to look. It is well worth the trip just to drive around the blocks and look at the interesting gardens.",

She was charged with unlawful assembly. The riot began as a demonstration timed to correspond with a visit by then-Vice-President Dan Quayle. She subsequently sued the city, claiming that her constitutional rights were violated when she was hand-cuffed for more than 3 and one half hours, forced to kneel for over an hour and cursed at by Police. The suit was subsequently settled and the criminal charges against her were dropped.[25] Hughes operated the Kitchen Table Cafe in Portland's Buckman neighborhood for most of the 1990s. During that time, she was on the Board of the Buckman Community Association.\"",

But comparatively few visitors to the city -- and not that many more locals -- have  likely seen the icon at the top of it in these two photos . . . and certainly not in this kind of weather, which is rare in itself and completely inappropriate for the icon. We Portland Walking Tour guides talk about this tower on the \"Best of Portland\" tour, and in more than four years of leading those tours, I've been able to show the dragon to no more than half a dozen groups. So I was kind of startled and delighted to see it out a month or so ago, and to be armed with my digital camera.\n\nI call it the Weather Beacon or Weather Tower; Wikipedia calls it the \"Weather Machine.\" It stands in Pioneer Courthouse Square, just east of the Starbucks. You're seeing the brick roof of Nordstrom, the new Park Avenue West Tower, and Fox Tower in the background of these shots.",

I think many of you will love this course if you 've lived here your whole life or you're brand new to town. Full disclosure, I lead many tours as a volunteer for Architectural Heritage Center and have led free ones for Hidden Portland but I do get paid for PUGS programs. It is limited to 20 and is likely to sell out so if you're interested best register sooner rather than later but it is being repeated in June as well.",

The old bridge will permanently close to traffic that day at 7 pm. From 7:30 ‚Äì 8:30 pm, residents can walk across the 90-year old bridge one last time. Bring your flashlights, electric candles, and phone lights for this candlelight event. A bagpiper in kilts will lead the gathered friends of the old bridge as we bid it farewell.\nParticipants should assemble on Grand Avenue off of Spokane street (near the bridge's north sidewalk) no earlier than 7 pm. The procession starts at 7:30 pm. We‚Äôll have time to walk from east to west and back again. The bridge will need to be cleared by 8:30 pm so that work to set up the new bridge for traffic can begin.",

And from the beginning, I was drawn to Big Pink. The name, it's color, it's ability to shift and change and stand alone. I'm a pretty big fan I guess, So who shows up to my artist reception -- the man who designed it! That was the tops!\n\nAnd then the next week the chance to meet again.

I think it's strange that you have to walk by a huge window looking in on surgeries to get to the outdoor memorial garden. Cool if that interests you, I was glad that the one surgery going on was not near the window. There's also some history and photos in the hallway.

Artwork was funded  primarily by the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Gresham Redevelopment Commission.\n\n* Tall, brightly painted steel rays constitute a highly visible landmark for the station and a beacon of civic pride for the community\n* Imagery was inspired by the ferris wheel-- once an annual feature in Rockwood, the bold colors of the Hispanic culture, and the universal symbolism of the sunrise\n* Translucent tips of the rays illuminate as the trains arrive and depart the station\n* Sunrise image also appears in the shelter glass pattern designed by Corson.\"\n\nfrom http://trimet.org/publicart/bluelinearteast.htm",

Standing 180' high it was the tallest structure in Portland (probably  the whole state) at the time even though Albina was independent until 1891. The shops made Albina's fortunes and began the transition of inner NE/N into the thriving part of town we know today, through many ups and downs of course. It was saved as an historic landmark by City Council in the 60's when the rest of the yards building were demolished. A lesson for the City Council of today? That is a rhetorical question btw.",

The metal shaft of wheat at the top of the pole also harkens back to the brewing process.   Originally the Henry Weinhard Brewery building, Henry‚Äôs Tavern is located at 10 NW 12th Avenue, corner of NW 12th & Burnside. The beautiful tudor-style brick building was completed in 1908 and is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nHenry Weinhard purchased an existing brewery on this site, the City Brewery, in 1864. Business boomed, and between 1865 and 1872 two additional blocks to the north were purchased. Weinhard's brewing business continued to expand to the point where he even offered to pipe beer directly to the Skidmore Fountain. This offer was declined by civic leaders. By 1890, the brewery produced 100,000 barrels of beer annually.\n\nMore info at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weinhard_Brewery_Complex",

Since malls are now kinda strange beings to me (though I lived in Minnesota many years of my life -- Mall land, but I hardly go in now since I've now  become one of those \"thrifters\") when I go in, I find I'm looking at the space like it's a museum and with a sense of curiosity.\n\nSo here's some of my Finds at Pioneer Place Mall in downtown Portland last week. Sorry I think the chance to see Hipster Santa is over, but I heard the lines were crazy long. I love the secret underground fountain in the food court and giant leaves above, and the Silver holiday balls are always so joyously large. And the displays for fancy handbags amused me. And the 'underground river' that jogs between sock stalls and hanging over the side planters are year round. And I do believe I've seen my first Bitcoin machine.",

If you can't help this time but want to help in January (or need a eve or weekend) Also let me know by commenting on the event page.\n\nLocation is inner SE Portland under the Hawthorne Bridge.\n\nCheers!

Super silly over the cat decor -- the owners are really nice people and while you do have to decide if paying $8 and hour to hang in a cat-tastic room while you have your tea and scone is worth your while -- for the novelty -- I'd say It was! Students -- you can get half off certain hours of the week and I have to say it was fun to have a Meowmosa! And there's even a Yoga and cats class and also film screenings.

Over 40 community members contributed to this project, many of whom collected data by searching out these quirky and hidden things, and taking a fresh deep look at this place we all love. The book was just listed on OPB's Fall Book list. Check out Hunter's talk at Powell's Books on November 23rd, or listen to his PDXTalks (linked below).",

I am a prolific #Wikipedia editor who writes about PDX's historic buildings, public art, and quirky culture. My article about the  Lovejoy Columns was recently promoted as some of Wikipedia's best work, so I thought I'd share the link here for readers who may be interested. Tom Stefopoulos painted these columns, which supported the Lovejoy Ramp in the Pearl, between 1948 and 1952. The viaduct was demolished in 1999, and these columns were later resited at Northwest 10th Avenue between Everett and Flanders streets. Enjoy!",

Jackson Memorial Bridge, access to the island is only  by boat. Government Island is known for its great blue heron colony and the Government Island State Recreation Area. The interior of the island, off limits to the public, contains a seasonal cattle ranch and protected natural areas, including Jewit Lake. There are also remnants of old pioneer buildings on the island (I really need to find this hidden treasure and photograph it). Many threatened or endangered wildlife species live on the island, including the red-legged frog, bald eagle, peregrine falcon, pileated woodpecker, little willow flycatcher, olive-sided flycatcher, western meadowlark, horned grebe, red-necked grebe, bufflehead, purple martin, and possibly the endangered Columbian white-tailed deer.",

Part of the tour was at my beloved historical crush's house (and burial ground) where the very same Eva Emery Dye (in a vignette in the parlor) was summoned to talk about how SHE saved his house to be a museum.\nIf only Eva Emery Dye and Carye Elizabeth Bye could meet to talk about our shared historical crush! She also seems to be a forerunner of the historical novel as the book (according to wikipedia) takes a little literary license! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Emery_Dye",

The practice of using the side of a  building to advertise was once common, but now it's rarely done. The remaining signs are fading reminders of a world that used to be.\n\nThis group is for sharing photographs and other notes about ghost signs in the Northwestern corner of the United States. Northwest is pretty liberally defined, basically Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/829963850435528",

I started it more so as a personal page to promote or give props to Portland and the projects and guides I've produced as an artist-archiver. In fact I was going to just call it Hidden Portland the same name as my website  but it was taken by someone else who was following up on the same thing as Hidden L.A. so I decided to call this Hidden Portland for the Curious --- and I couldn't have been happier.. because it's all about curiosity here.\n\nNow this group that began as 1 is something I consider amazing because of all of you.

We are in fact  creating a bit of an archive and collective documentation of Portland which is great for many reasons -- my favorite inspiring your own exploration.\n\nThe handy search tool is great if you want to go visit a specific part of town or a specific kind of art, etc. Try searching your favorite subject or genre. For example if you like Mermaids -- search for mermaids about Portland or if you want to spend a day in Oregon City. Search what posts have been made to get an idea of some unique or interesting places to visit there.",

Most of it will be a walking tour in closer-in town. Stops  include: the Elevator, McLoughlin House (Dr J my historical crush!), Barclay House and the Stevens-Crawford Heritage House.\n\nThe walking is 1 hour and leaves every 15 minutes all night long! The Rose Farm is an extra stop that can be visited after the tour.\n\nJust thought I'd pass on this unique tour and way to see many of the historic homes of Oregon City. By the way... I kid you not, my last visit to the McLoughlin house I had a weird experience that was shared with the friend I went on the tour with---while downstairs we heard a tour upstairs. When we got up there.. no one was there.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1677913332495233/",

As I was new to town I forgot where it  was and spent more than ten years trying to locate it. Eventually I gave up and assumed it had been torn down. Then about five years ago I stumbled across it by accident. As far as I know it is the only log structure left in town that is not a 20th century kit but a remnant of the log buildings once scattered across the Portland area. Lombard Ave @ Berkley St.",

Too bad it's not also a fountain but a cool sculpture with some bright accents that you can walk around and through.\n\nAlso not far from that but off of SW first before Arthur is another fountain park plaza but this one a little more private in the ADP Plaza, now looking like it is called KBS ADP Plaza -- I worked at ADP for a few years in my early days here in Portland and I never realized how cool this fountain was at ",

It also features bike friendly (front entrance, rear exit) elevators on both ends and regular patrols have kept them from becoming de-facto toilets. Nice hidden commuter route if you're headed to from Sellwood, Milwaukie, or all points thereafter.",

Continuing east on Main St. I passed a bicycle \"dude\" before finding more benches--one a whimsical Luck Dragon in front of SE Uplfit (SE 35th and Main) and next to that a little park space with an invite to sit and enjoy.\n\nWow what a wonderful stroll.

I knew there were quite a few but did not realize the magnitude of how many there were especially in the 19-teens to the 30s. I liked hearing stories about the movie palaces and how often they just played a continuous loop and there were even some dedicated to just news reels. There's some theatres still in use today (not always still as a movie house) but many are just gone.\n\nIt didn't dawn ",

That iconic colorful fruit market sign always stood out to me. (It was a place called Corno's originally) Then it disappeared (when the property was demolished I think for the pipe project, and really changed the look of the district for me). When I was doing research for my Portland at Large guidebook I read that City Liquidators saved the fruit and that another resale shop City Home (139 SE Taylor St, not sure how long they've been here). was reselling it. OF course I didn't remember to look at how much, but it was fun to see parts of the old famous central eastside market.\n\nHere's some pictures in the City Liquidator's memory museum and then a photo of the sign at City Home just a few blocks away.",

Foster's walk of Slabtown I learned about a fun little nook of businesses at NW 18th and Vaughn -- so I stopped in today for a longer look -- In a very industrial area, it's like a little  oasis...see the photos!\n\nWhat I like is four separate businesses kind of meld from one to the next and everyone working there was so nice today as I wandered and took photos of statues & plants for sale. There's also some office spaces (very nice!) tucked in and long benches and it's part of the nursery so you are free to wander the whole thing. I came across some guys eating lunch and asked if they had office space there, they said nope, we work around the corner, we come here from lunch!\n\nThe event space on the corner (Castaways) combos with the sculpture & fountain place with an outdoor patio that can be rented out and has that really cool bear sculpture that was posted before on here. There was one more adjacent business selling sculpture and really nice pots that I checked out but they were kinda snooty and unlike the 4 others collaborating and co-mingling.",

So much beautiful detail, the  entire original main hallway preserved and some interesting huge cut outs. A fun building to explore. I got to go on a tour BEFORE the construction, so it was fun to see it after. (one day I'll find those photos and post some below)\n\nI suggest visiting the building next time they are hosting an art opening or if during day hours, their library is pretty incredible and open to the public.\n\nON my visit one thesis exhibit had a fabric-made whale you could sit in, but sadly it closed this weekend before I could tell you about it. OH they have this \"collections\" room with a bunch of cookie jars right now for inspiration. That was super cool!\n\nBuilding is at 511 NW Broadway",

Walk around the \"island\" or walk through the island.\n\nAlso while there, let's do some neighborly clean up -- there's some beach trash and such, bring a bag to haul out some of the garbage (before the plastic bags etc get into the river/animals) on your way out.

It had all the bells and whistles as you can see and remnants of it are still to be seen inside Pioneer Courthouse and the Architectural Heritage Center on SE Grand.

Oddball Shoe company -- an employee came out with a really large shoe (not really for human feet) Located: 1801 NW Thurman St,\n\n-Really unique triangle building with a cafe in one angle near Fremont Bridge. Cafe is called Breken Kitchen\n\n-The Dockside Saloon & Restaurant (2047 NW Front) is looking now so out of place. It used to fit in the neighborhood and feel almost dockside to the Willamette. Now all these new condo/apt buildings line up across from it... and Starbucks I know is desperate for that corner\n\n- A glimpse of old Portland -- looking up NW Upshur at 18th\n\n-The New York on NW York St around NW 21st\n\n-A peek into a micro apts kitchen/laundry on NW Thurman between 22nd and 23rd",

Here are pictures of each museum and a detail!\n\nThree in Troutdale: The Depot Rail Museum, The Barn Museum -- which has a brand new  exhibit \"Kings of the Road\" 100th anniversary show for the historic Columbia River Hwy, and the 1900-built Harlow House Museum. In Fairview, the Heslin House Museum & Jail and the Zimmerman Heritage Farm from 1874 in Gresham.\n\nAll run by volunteers -- most are donation, the Barn Museum has a fee, but is free for Multnomah county residents. Support and learn local history! You don't have to have a car to explore....we went by bicycle to all the museums. The Zimmerman House has a bus 21 stop across the way, The Troutdale museums have a couple bus lines nearby, and looks like the 77 gets you close to the Heslin house with a little bit of walking. I think all of these are open Saturdays in the summer, some are every third Saturday, so check online or call. http://echohistory.org/ and https://www.troutdalehistory.org/museums.html",

I was super delighted, I've never seen it played in the metro area, though I'm sure it is in other places. This park is in a strange industrial land along I-84. The players not playing were hiding in the few trees on the side.\n\nPS. This is around the corner the Candy Basket factory famous for the chocolate waterfall. We heard its been broken and stopped in -- indeed it still is and they don't know when they will get it fixed :(",

If you've never been, it's a great way to spend an evening viewing lots of wonderful art in the many galleries in the district, as well as  other local businesses and the open air market along NW 13th. Plus plenty of hors d'oeuvres and wines to sample, live music, and many other surprises, such as free mini beauty services from a participating salon.\n\nThe one hidden gem I'm posting about however is Gann Bros. Printing. --The oldest print shop in Portland, They're at the corner of NW 14th and Johnson. A small family owned and operating printing company with Heidelberg presses and mini hand operated presses which they allowed visitors to use to make their own coasters for the 4th of July.\n\nThey participate in every First Thursday, but were very quick to add that if you're in the area and see the light is on, to please come in! They'd love to give you a tour and explain how their presses work And how, in sufficient quantities, their services are actually much less expensive than what modern print shops charge.",

    "text": "I guess there's not much room these hot days on the public dock on the other side of Hawthorne so folks are now hanging out as well on the one by the fireboat house. Or maybe I just don't go by at prime times.  I don't remember the door being there on the boat dock that leads to the fire & rescue boats -- but maybe it was added because of increased activity or maybe it was always the plan or I just finally noticed it.\n\nPortland's certainly got a new view of the Willamette since I arrived 15 years ago. NO ONE went in the water then. And I only would go in at the Columbia/Willamette confluence at Kelly Point Park. I know the Big Float was the big motivator to get people into water recreation again, but I have to admit I still can't bring myself to swim or recreate on the Willamette. Maybe by the end of summer this will change but I'm still more apt to head off to the Sandy or Clackamas -- both accessible by public transit by the way!\n\nIt's a bit of a gamble to post here as it may turn into a opinion-fest and if so I'll pull it, but just an observation about Portland's changing landscape!",

There's a  handy search button when you are on this group page on your desktop computer, and it's super useful if you want to find a previous post or to look for like themes. So remember use your KEY WORDS when you post and if you find yourself every typing \"This...is cool\", Change the word \"This\" to words describing what you are looking at. Sure we can see it now, but those key words are more for searchability later!",

    "text": "FRIDAY morning there's a pretty important \"Making History\" moment happening here in Portland at the Lone Fir Cemetery. If you are free, I encourage you to attend!\n\nRecently Madison High School students went on a  history visit to the Lone Fir cemetery with local historian and author Jd Chandler and they learned that there's no memorial for Portland's first black firefighter (born 1860 and died in 1909). Gus Waterford's grave lacks even a tombstone. Most ordinary tour goers would just sigh, and say .. that's too bad. Not this exceptional crew curious about keeping history alive. Do to their own project they have helped get Gus a memorial at last!\n\nThe dedication/gathering/ceremony will happen at 11:30 at the firefighters section of the cemetery, near the center -- here's a pre-story: http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/05/gus_waterford_black_firefighte.html\n\nand Here's the event: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/fire/article/535312\nBefore the event at Lone Fir there is an 10 am annual memorial gathering at the Portland Firefighter's Park (NW 18th and W Burnside).",

However I'm hoping to get together some limited edition art/prizes for each section completed. We'll see, no real promises there. And we should hopefully make it to Paul Bunyan before sunset. I don't lead a lot of bike rides these days so don't miss out on this free tour of some of our MONDO MASSIVE \"friends\"",

Our family would make the trek to San Francisco for treatment often and one of the  things I remember most was crossing the Bay Bridge. My mother is one of the strongest people I know. As our car would close in on the Bay Bridge, you could see the fear in my mom's eyes. She was not strong then. Nearly every time we crossed she'd have a bit of a panic attack.\n\nAfter a childhood of that, I'm still not sure why I moved to the bridge city. My mom managed to pass her fear onto me. I've been here over 10 years now. While it's not as scary as it used to be, my heart does still race every time I cross a bridge today.\n\nThe one that scares me the most is tthis. The St. Johns bridge. When I'm on top, I feel too high up. Like it will crumble into the river at any moment, and when it does, it'll take me with it. When I'm below it, I feel like there are giants closing in around me.",

We'll ride and stop a lot on this tour (please eat before or bring snacks since we won't have time for a dinner stop).
