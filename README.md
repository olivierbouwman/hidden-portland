# Next steps
1. Find a way to keep the post list updated reliably and at least once a day. Idea is to use the Facebook Groups API for this but it's currently broken (https://developers.facebook.com/support/bugs/586024735942061). We could try the crawler approach and see for how long it'll work. Likely use GitHub Action to get new posts once a day and update the data file.
