Through you, HP becomes a living archive of our fair city. Our motto is STAY CURIOUS!\n\n\"Hidden\" refers to a state of mind. It means finding something new to you OR a new perspective on something you've  seen before. New discoveries, ideas, info, light, angles, juxtaposition, patterns, delight, etc. about Portland are all welcome.\n\n\"Curious\" means we like to wonder, sleuth, discover. Leave your thinking/judgmental brain aside, and let yourself experience Portland with all your senses and a full dose of curiosity. We prefer questions to criticisms.\n\n ",
